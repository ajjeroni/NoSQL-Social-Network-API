# NoSQL-Social-Network-API

## Description

For this task, students had to develop an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list using technologies such as MongoDB, mongoose, express.js, and insomnia (to test routes).

This application was really fun to create as there is a lot of overlap with mysql, which I have experience with, but MongoDB is much easier and faster to use since it doesn't tables, primary keys, and foreign keys. 

## Usage

run "npm i"

run "npm run seed"

run "npm run dev"

open insomnia and run routes as desired
